# ðŸ”¬ Q-P Plot Digitizer

A data mining tool for extracting rock mechanics data from published research papers and open access theses. This tool digitizes Q-P (differential stress vs. mean stress) plots to create statistically significant datasets.

## Project Overview

This innovative project tests the hypothesis that **rock failure strength can be predicted using only grain size and porosity values** - based on the equivalence of critical state soil mechanics and Byerlee friction (Rutter & Glover, 2012).

## Features

### Plot Digitization
- Upload Q-P plot images (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
- Interactive axis calibration with visual feedback
- Per-sandstone data extraction and validation
- Real-time point visualization with customizable colors

### Data Management
- PostgreSQL database with comprehensive schema
- Browse and search digitized plots
- Export data as CSV files
- Bulk data operations

### Database Querying
- **SQL Interface**: Direct database queries with safety controls
- **Natural Language Queries**: AI-powered query generation
- Query history and examples
- Read-only access with automatic limits


##  Usage

### 1. Digitize a Plot
1. **Upload**: Select a Q-P plot image
2. **Configure**: Enter DOI, figure number, and number of sandstone datasets
3. **Calibrate**: Click on known axis points to set coordinate system
4. **Extract**: Click on data points for each sandstone individually
5. **Validate**: Review extracted points with visual overlay
6. **Save**: Automatic database storage after validation

### 2. Manage Data
- Browse all digitized plots with search and filtering
- View detailed statistics and data points
- Export individual plots or bulk data as CSV
- Delete plots with cascade removal

### 3. Query Database
- **SQL Tab**: Write custom SQL queries with built-in examples
- **AI Tab**: Ask questions in natural language
- View results in formatted tables
- Export query results as CSV
